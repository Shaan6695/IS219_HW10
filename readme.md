# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

# IS 219 HW10

# Documentation
This HW10 assignment has been very difficult for me and there were many things to learn. It was overwhelming having to deal with the many new things that were added to this assignment and the large amount of code and files was something I have not worked with before. A lot of this homework assignment required me to search up issues that I was having online and that was a great cource of action as that did help solving some of my issues I was having.
