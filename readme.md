# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

# IS 219 HW10

# Documentation
This HW10 assignment has been very difficult for me and there were many things to learn. It was overwhelming having to deal with the many new things that were added to this assignment and the large amount of code and files was something I have not worked with before. A lot of this homework assignment required me to search up issues that I was having online and that was a great cource of action as that did help solving some of my issues I was having. 

Debugging some of the issues in this program was difficult but I felt like I did learn quite a bit after completing this assignment. Using git for version control was very useful and this assignment showed me why. There were times when I would commit and push my working code to github and then the next commit I would have issues, so I would go back to my working commit and see what I changed to spot the error I was having. This assignment really showed me the importance of being organized and working slowly, because a lot of the time when you work too fast, errors emerge that can be hard to track and fix. Testing was absolutely important and without the tests it would be extremely difficult to find errors in your code and debug them. Testing different scenarios like user authentication, correct password and email, etcâ€¦ broadened my understanding of what tests are capable of and how important they are

Learning how restapi, docker, and pytest, documentation worked was also a learning experience that I found to be valuable to me. This assignment definitely leveled me up as a software engineer and I think this assignment is a great assignment to go back to and add new features in on my own time as well
